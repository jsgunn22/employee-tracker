# employee-tracker

## Description

Managing Employees as the change Roles and Departments can be tedious and time consuming when done with pen and paper. The Employee tracker allows us to add employees upon hire and remove them when terminated. Link each Employee to a Role which includes a salary and linked Department and assign another Manager as their Superior. Users are also able to configure Departments, Roles, and Employees which will affect eachother dynamically.
